# IBM APP CONNECT ENTERPRISE

![ACE Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ot4i/ace-helm/master/appconnect_enterprise_logo.svg?sanitize=true)

## Introduction

IBMÂ® App Connect Enterprise is a market-leading lightweight enterprise integration engine that offers a fast, simple way for systems and applications to communicate with each other. As a result, it can help you achieve business value, reduce IT complexity and save money. IBM App Connect Enterprise supports a range of integration choices, skills and interfaces to optimize the value of existing technology investments.

## Chart Details

By default this chart deploys a single IBM App Connect Enterprise for Developers integration server into a Kubernetes environment.

To deploy a production IBM App Connect Enterprise integration server, [check the installation instructions](README.md#installation-for-production).

## Prerequisites

* Kubernetes 1.9 or greater, with beta APIs enabled
* If persistence is enabled (see [configuration](#configuration)), then you either need to create a PersistentVolume, or specify a Storage Class if classes are defined in your cluster.
* If you have [pod security policy control](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#enabling-pod-security-policies) enabled, you must have a [PodSecurityPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/) that supports the following [securityContext](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/security-context/) settings:
  * capabilities:
    * CHOWN
    * DAC_OVERRIDE
    * FSETID
    * FOWNER
    * NET_RAW
    * SETGID
    * SETUID
    * SETFCAP
    * SETPCAP
    * NET_BIND_SERVICE
    * SYS_CHROOT
    * KILL
    * AUDIT_WRITE
  * allowPrivilegeEscalation: true
  * readOnlyRootFilesystem: false
  * runAsNonRoot: false
  * runAsUser: 0
  * privileged: false
  
* On RedHat OpenShift a [Security Context Constraint](https://blog.openshift.com/understanding-service-accounts-sccs/) should be used in place of a pod security policy. The recommended Security Context Constraint is shown below:
```
kind: SecurityContextConstraints
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: ibm-ace-scc
allowPrivilegedContainer: true
runAsUser:
  type: RunAsAny
seLinuxContext:
  type: RunAsAny
fsGroup:
  type: RunAsAny
supplementalGroups:
  type: RunAsAny
requiredDropCapabilities:
- MKNOD
allowedCapabilities:
- SETPCAP
- AUDIT_WRITE
- CHOWN
- NET_RAW
- DAC_OVERRIDE
- FOWNER
- FSETID
- KILL
- SETUID
- SETGID
- NET_BIND_SERVICE
- SYS_CHROOT
- SETFCAP  
forbiddenSysctls:
- '*'    
```
* **Note**: If you are deploying to an IBM Cloud Private environment that does not support these security settings by default. Follow these [instructions](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBS6K_3.1.0/app_center/nd_helm.html) to enable your deployment.

* If you are using SELinux you must meet the [MQ requirements](https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21714191)

## Resources Required

This chart uses the following resources by default:

* 1 CPU core
* 1 GiB memory without MQ
* 2 GiB memory with MQ

See the [configuration](#configuration) section for how to configure these values.

## Installing the Chart

First, upload your ACE and/or ACE & MQ images to a Docker registry. You will have to indicate the location of these images in the chart installation.
To build your ACE / ACE & MQ images, read the [instructions in the `ace-docker` repository](https://github.com/ot4i/ace-docker).

If using a private Docker registry, an image pull secret needs to be created before installing the chart. Supply the name of the secret as the value for `image.pullSecret`.

**By default this chart installs IBM App Connect Enterprise for Developers (without MQ).**

### ACE for Developers installation

1. ACE for Developers only:

To install the chart with the release name `ace-dev`:
```
helm install --name ace-dev ibm-ace --set license=accept --set image.repository.aceonly={docker-repo/ace-image-name} --set image.tag={image-tag}
```

1. ACE & MQ Advanced for Developers:

To install the chart with the release name `ace-mq-dev`:
```
helm install --name ace-mq-dev ibm-ace --set license=accept --set image.repository.acemq={docker-repo/ace-mq-image-name} --set image.tag={image-tag} --set queueManagerEnabled=true
```

### ACE installation

1. ACE only:

To install the chart with the release name `ace`:
```
helm install --name ace ibm-ace --set license=accept --set image.repository.aceonly={docker-repo/ace-image-name} --set image.tag={image-tag} --set devEdition=false
```

1. ACE & MQ Advanced:

To install the chart with the release name `ace-mq`:
```
helm install --name ace-mq ibm-ace --set license=accept --set image.repository.acemq={docker-repo/ace-mq-image-name} --set image.tag={image-tag} --set queueManagerEnabled=true --set devEdition=false
```

- **Note:** If installing to a pre-production or production environment, also set `productionDeployment` to `true` on the installation command.

To deploy an IBM App Connect Enterprise server on the Kubernetes cluster this command:
- accepts the [IBM App Connect Enterprise license](../LICENSE)
- sets the docker repository + image name for `aceonly` or `acemq`
- sets the image tag
- sets whether MQ is to be enabled with `queueManagerEnabled`
- sets if the image used is a Developers edition with `devEdition`.
The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

- **Tip**: See all the resources deployed by the chart using `kubectl get all -l release={release-name}`

**Important**: Due to Helm secret management anyone with access to tiller can run a `helm get values` command and see secret information in plain text (https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/2196) - only administrators or cluster administrators should have access to tiller. The {{ RELEASE }}-ibm-ace secret is created as part of this chart. If you are concerned about access to this information please replace these after installation separate from the helm release then delete the {{ RELEASE }}-ibm-ace-XXXXX pods: (Please see the [configuration](#configuration) section for how to configure these values):
- **mqsc**
- **keystorePassword**
- **keystoreKey-{{ $key }}**
- **keystoreCert-{{ $key }}**
- **keystorePass-{{ $key }}**
- **truststorePassword**
- **truststoreCert-{{ $key }}**
- **odbcini**
- **policy**
- **policyDescriptor**
- **serverconf**
- **setdbparms**
- **viewerusers**

Alternatively, create the secret `{{ .RELEASE.NAME }}-ibm-ace` by modifying the secrets.yaml file appropriately and creating it by running `kubectl create -f secrets.yaml`, and then removing it from the chart so that it is separated from the release.

## Installing a sample image

If you have built your own docker image following the [docker instructions in `ace-docker`](https://github.com/ot4i/ace-docker) and you want to test installing the [`sample` image](https://github.com/ot4i/ace-docker/sample), we have provided a file `samplevalues.yaml` that has all the values needed to run the sample image. All the values in the `initial-config` folders are set in the `integrationServer` key in this file.

To install the chart using ACE only and the sample values:

```
helm install --name ace-dev ibm-ace --set license=accept -f=samplevalues.yaml --set image.repository.aceonly={docker-repo/ace-image-name} --set image.tag={image-tag}
```

To install the chart using ACE & MQ and the sample values:

```
helm install --name ace-mq-dev ibm-ace --set license=accept -f=samplevalues.yaml --set image.repository.acemq={docker-repo/ace-mq-image-name} --set image.tag={image-tag} --set queueManagerEnabled=true
```


## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete a `rel1` release:

```
helm delete --purge rel1
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart, except any Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs). This is the default behaviour of Kubernetes, and ensures that valuable data is not deleted.

## Extra features in IBM Cloud Private: IBM ACE Dashboard

When installing in IBM Cloud Private you also have access to IBM ACE Dashboard, which provides a UI to manage Integration Servers. You can install the IBM ACE Dashboard for Developers from ICP catalog, search for `ibm-ace-dashboard-dev`. If you have loaded the ACE cloud pack then you can also install the production IBM ACE Dashboard `ibm-ace-dashboard-prod`.

Once the Dashboard is installed, any ACE Integration Servers or ACE & MQ integration servers that are deployed using the installation instructions here will show up in the Dashboard UI.
For these servers to be able to be inspected in the Dashboard, an extra user needs to be added to the installation configuration:
Add an entry for a user with read access named `ibm-ace-dashboard-viewer` to `integrationServer.viewerusers` so the Dashboard UI can display information from the server.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart.

- **Tip**: You can use the default [values.yaml](values.yaml)

## Storage

When Queue Manager is enabled, the chart mounts a [Persistent Volume](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/persistent-volumes/) for the storage of MQ configuration data and messages.  By using a Persistent Volume based on network-attached storage, Kubernetes can re-schedule the MQ server onto a different worker node. You should not use "hostPath" or "local" volumes, because this will not allow moving between nodes. The default size of the persistent volume claim is 2Gi.

Performance requirements will vary widely based on workload, but as a guideline, use a Storage Class which allows for at least 200 IOPS (based on 16 KB block size with a 50/50 read/write mix).

For volumes that support onwership management, specify the group ID of the group owning the persistent volumes' file systems using the `fsGroupGid` parameter.

## Logging

The `log.format` value controls whether the format of the output logs is:
- basic: Human readable format intended for use in development, such as when viewing through `kubectl logs`
- json: Provides more detailed information for viewing through Kibana

## Limitations

This Chart can run only on amd64 architecture type.
